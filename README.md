### Hi there!

I am Caroline Bertemes (she/her), a postdoctoral astrophysicist at Heidelberg University. \
My research interests lie in the broad field of AGN and galaxy evolution, and I am a developer for the [q3dfit](https://github.com/Q3D/q3dfit) python package for PSF deconvolution and spectral analysis. For more information, please feel free to have a look at my [personal webpage](https://cbertemes.github.io/)!
